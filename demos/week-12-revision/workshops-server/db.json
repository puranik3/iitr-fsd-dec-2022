(This flexibility has led to the acronym MVW, which stands for \"model-view-whatever\" and may also encompass model–view–presenter and model–view–adapter.)</p>",

Typically, JavaScript is used primarily for client-side scripting, in which scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting - running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a \"JavaScript everywhere\" paradigm, unifying web application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server side and client side scripts.</p><p>The Node.js distributed development project, governed by the Node.js Foundation, is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.</p>",
